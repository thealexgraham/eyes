Wake up, discover that you are the Eyes of the World.

There heart has its beaches its homelands and thoughts of its own.

Wake now to find out that you are the song that the morning brings,
but the heart has its seasons its evenins and songs of its own.


A collection of software for running the Eyes keybord (AKA the Launchpad).

This will include:
- instrument selection
- context sensitive sliders
- colors corresponding to effects
- Crazy colors
- delay heaven

The Haskell portion will be the part of the software that analyzes and
spits out code. Possibly do a similar thing in supercollider that I did in
Max, or just do it in max like I did it in Max. We'll see. This may be two
seperate projects

:)
