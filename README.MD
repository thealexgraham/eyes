Wake up, discover that you are the Eyes of the World.

A collection of software for running the Eyes keybord (AKA the Launchpad).

This will include:
- instrument selection
- context sensitive sliders
- colors corresponding to effects
- Crazy colors
- delay heaven

The Haskell portion will be the part of the software that analyzes and
spits out code, as well as keeping track of the state. Possibly do a similar
thing in supercollider that I did in kMax, or just do it in max like 
I did it in Max. We'll see. This may be twoseperate projects
